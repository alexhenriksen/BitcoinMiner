# BitcoinMiner
Script for calculating the new hash when given: block number, transactions, previous hash and difficulty.

The difficulty at the time of writing this is 20

The coding for bitcoin mining is very simple it's the hardware and electrical power needed to calculate the new hash which makes it so hard.
The script does not actually mine bitcoins in real life it just shows you how it can be done. So all the values in the script are not relevant in todays day and age.

But be sure to try running the code and see how by given a block number, the previous transactions, the previous hash and the current difficulty you can calculate the new hash.
